### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

### About Me:

- ðŸ”­   I am currently working as travel demand modeler at [Cambridge Systematics, Inc.](https://camsys.com/). Most of my job includes developing/applying/modifying trip-based and activity-based travel demand models but I also do exploratory data analysis with various types of data such as surveys, vehicle trajectories, [gtfs](https://gtfs.org/) etc. 

- ðŸŒ±   I am recently exploring AI/ML applications in the transportation domain.

- :zap: I believe in hands-on learning and spend most of my free time in exploring new technologies through experiments and development.
